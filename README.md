# Ask-A-Question
A web app built using MEAN stack frameworks that allows users to create a question with multiple-choice style answers that other viewers can vote on. Express.js and Node.js run the back-end, Angular.js gives the layout for the front-end, and MongoDB is used for the database.

If you are a first-time user, register on main page and you will be taken to the dashboard of the app which displays all of the existing questions and the users who posted them. From the dashboard, you can view a question by clicking on it or you can add your on question with options by clicking on "New Poll" in the navbar. A new poll can be submitted with a question and up to four different options. Once a new poll is submitted, the user is redirected back to the dashboard where their poll is now available to view. If you view a question, you will also the author, the options to vote on, and a vote button for each option along with the current number of votes for each option. Once a user is registered, they will have the option of deleting questions only if they are the author of the question. This will show up as an option on the dashboard next to questions the user has created. If the user needs to logout, there is logout on the right of the navbar at the top of every page.
